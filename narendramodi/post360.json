It is difficult to imagine Thuglak and Cho without each other. He was a multi-faceted personality. Cho was a master of humour & satire. His satire stood out because it made his criticism loveable, even to those he criticised.\n\nCho made Thuglak a platform for all. He made the magazine a weapon against all divisive forces & fought for a corruption-free system. I \u200ewish Shri S. Gurumurthy & his team the best. I hope they take Thuglak to new heights and carry forward the legacy of Cho.", "type": "link", "id": "177526890164_10158161311680165", "status_type": "shared_story"}
