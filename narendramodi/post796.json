Launched PMO App & met many people who contribute in #MannKiBaat programmes & several other activities on MyGov. They enrich our democracy.\n\nThe questions were diverse & touched areas like the economy, governance issues, healthcare, tourism, agriculture & farmer welfare. An often asked question on whether I get tired due to travelling & foreign policy also featured in the Townhall. \nhttp://nm-4.com/732t", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10157353785055165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
