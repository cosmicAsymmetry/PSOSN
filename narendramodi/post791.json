Brought back memories of my 2013 rally. Thankful to all who joined. \n\nHighlighted Central Government\u2019s efforts in energy sector, coastal development, agriculture & economic reforms initiated in last 2 years. Illustrated how NDA Government is constantly working for the welfare of the marginalised, Dalits & helping them fulfil their aspirations. Solution to every problem is development. Let us leave any form of politics that divides society. No good will come out of this. \n\nOur Government understands the strength of the people of India. Our High Command is the 125 crore people of India. \nhttp://nm-4.com/0u4t", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10157358158390165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
