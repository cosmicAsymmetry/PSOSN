Guided by love for India & determined to take India to new heights of progress, generations of Karyakartas devoted their lives to the Party.\n\nFrom Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Kutch to Arunachal Pradesh, people have reposed faith in BJP & see BJP as a party to fulfil their dreams. Wherever BJP has formed Governments, they served people in an exemplary manner. BJP is proud of its industrious CMs serving in many states.", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10156871740175165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
