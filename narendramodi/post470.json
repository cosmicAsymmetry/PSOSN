No longer will the progress & prosperity of rural India be curtailed by corruption & black money. Our villages must get their due. \n\nI always said that the Government's measure will bring a degree of inconvenience but this short term pain will pave way for long term gains.\n\nWe also have a historic opportunity to embrace increased cashless payments & integrate latest technology in economic transactions. Together, we must ensure #IndiaDefeatsBlackMoney. This will empower the poor, neo-middle class, middle class & benefit future generations.", "type": "status", "id": "177526890164_10157954048535165", "status_type": "mobile_status_update"}
