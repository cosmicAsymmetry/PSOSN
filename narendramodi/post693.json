This is the third time I am attending these Summits.\n\nASEAN is a key partner for our Act East Policy, which is vital for the economic development of our Northeastern region. Our strategic partnership with ASEAN is also important for safeguarding and promoting our security interests and countering traditional and non-traditional security challenges in the region. East Asia Summit is the premier forum for discussions on the challenges and opportunities before the Asia Pacific region.\n\nOur ties with the countries of South East Asia are truly historic.\n\nOur engagement and approach can be best encapsulated in just one word - connectivity. We wish to enhance our physical and digital connectivity; to see greater people to people links; to strengthen our institutional linkages; and, to leverage the modern interconnected world for the mutual benefit of all our people.\n\nDuring the visit, I will also have the opportunity to interact with the leaders of participating countries to discuss bilateral issues of mutual concern.", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10157505242075165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
