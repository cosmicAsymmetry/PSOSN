Our MPs must be congratulated for their path breaking decision to give India an indirect tax system for the 21st century. \n\nWe will continue to work with all parties & states to introduce a system that benefits all Indians & promotes a vibrant & unified national market. \n\nThis reform will promote 'Make in India', help exports & thus boost employment while providing enhanced revenue. I would like to add that GST will also be the best example of cooperative federalism. Together we will take India to new heights of progress.", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10157340115000165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
