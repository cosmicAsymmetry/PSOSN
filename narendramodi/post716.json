I will arrive in Hangzhou from Vietnam where I would have concluded an important bilateral visit. \n\nDuring the G-20 Summit, I will have an opportunity to engage with other world leaders on pressing international priorities and challenges. We will discuss putting the global economy on the track of sustainable steady growth and responding to emerging and entrenched social, security and economic challenges. \n \nIndia will engage constructively on all the issues before us and work towards finding solutions and taking forward the agenda for a robust, inclusive and sustainable international economic order that uplifts the socio-economic conditions of people across the world, especially those who need it most in developing  countries. \n\nI look forward to a productive and outcome oriented Summit.", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10157482808445165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
