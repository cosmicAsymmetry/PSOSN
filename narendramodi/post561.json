The exhibition was very informative.\n\nTalked about various facets of Sardar Patel\u2019s personality- focus on women empowerment, his devotion to Gandhi Ji & administrative skills. Sardar Patel unified India. This unity in diversity is our strength. Highlighted ways our states can deepen collaboration & deepen bonds.\n\nWhatever Sardar Patel did, it was for India. There was never any selfishness or promoting interests of his family. http://nm-4.com/dkjy", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10157771773880165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
