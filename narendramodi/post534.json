It is also heartening to learn that people are actively volunteering to help senior citizens withdraw money & exchange their currency.\n\nSuch warmth, enthusiasm & the patience to bear limited inconvenience for a greater good is indeed very heartening. I assure you the Govt is unwavering in its effort to create an India that is corruption free & fruits of development touch every citizen.", "type": "status", "id": "177526890164_10157821619360165", "status_type": "mobile_status_update"}
