Inspired by their seniors, most of these cricketers picked up the game in their school days. Today, they are an inspiration to all of us! \n\nI congratulate the coaches, parents, friends & teachers of these cricketers who supported them during this unforgettable journey. Best wishes to the entire team that won the T-20 Cricket World Cup for the Blind. Keep playing well and making India proud of your game.", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10158379189040165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
