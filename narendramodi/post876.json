I will also be meeting \u2018Solar Mamas\u2019, a group of rural women solar engineers from Africa who have been trained under GOI-supported programmes to fabricate, install, use, repair and maintain solar lanterns and household solar lighting systems in their villages.\n\nI will interact with the Indian community as well.", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10157219121060165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
