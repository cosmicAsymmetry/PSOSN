Leaders would discuss ways and measure through which to strengthen the global nuclear security architecture, especially to ensure that non-state actors do not get access to nuclear material.  \n\nOn the sidelines of the Summit, I would meet with several world leaders to carry forward the agenda of bilateral cooperation with those nations. \n\nI also look forward to my interaction with the scientists associated with LIGO project.", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10156832462570165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
