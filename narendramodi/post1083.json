Always happy to be in J&K. \n\nSports complex inaugurated today will most certainly promote sports but at the same time it will enhance sportsman spirit, which is vital.\n\nHad a very good interaction with students of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University. Delighted to see outstanding academic performance by girl students. Wished students the very best & urged them to work for the welfare of the poor in any way possible in the future. http://www.narendramodi.in/pm-modi-at-the-5th-convocation-of-shri-mata-vaishno-devi-university-in-katra-440900", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10156922862660165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
