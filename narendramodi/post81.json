This will be the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Spain in almost three decades. \n\nI will have the honour of calling on His Majesty King Felipe VI during this visit.\n\nI look forward to my meeting with President Mariano Rajoy on 31 May. We will discuss ways to enhance bilateral engagement, especially in the economic sphere, and cooperation on international issues of common concern, particularly in combating terrorism. \n\nThere is significant potential for deepening bilateral trade and investment ties. We seek active participation of Spanish industry in various Indian projects including infrastructure, smart cities, digital economy, renewable energy, defence and tourism.\n\nI will also meet top CEOs of Spanish industry and encourage them to partner with us in our 'Make in India' Initiative.\n\nThe first meeting of the India-Spain CEOs Forum will be held on the sidelines of my visit. I look forward to their valuable recommendations for strengthening India-Spain economic partnership.", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10158827875920165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
