Over two days on 7th and 8th July, I look forward to engaging leaders from other G-20 countries on the vital issues affecting our world today that have a bearing on economic growth, sustainable development, and peace and stability. \n\nWe will review progress on decisions since the Hangzhou Summit last year and deliberate on issues of terrorism, climate, sustainable development, growth and trade, digitalisation, health, employment, migration, women\u2019s empowerment, and partnership with Africa. The theme chosen for this year is \u201cShaping an Inter-connected World\u201d. \n\nAs in the past, I look forward to the opportunity to meet leaders on the side lines of the Summit to exchange views on bilateral matters of mutual interest.", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10159023973715165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
