They belong to militancy affected families, orphanages & weaker sections. The youngsters from J&K, who are in Delhi as a part of \"Wattan Ko Jano\" initiative amazed me with their curiosity. They asked me many questions. \n\nMy young friends are very passionate about J&K's progress & want good infrastructure in the state.  Spoke about steps for J&K's development, including in areas like tourism, digital connectivity, housing for all. http://nm-4.com/srkc", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10156504842375165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
