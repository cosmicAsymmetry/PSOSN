King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, I will be visiting Saudi Arabia, \n\nIndia\u2019s ties with Saudi Arabia are special. Robust people-to-people ties constitute a key component of our engagement. I plan to work with the Saudi leadership to expand and deepen our bilateral relations. Discussions on the regional situation would also be on the agenda. \n\nOur economic ties are also expanding. Saudi Arabia is India\u2019s 4th largest trading partner, and is also India\u2019s largest crude oil supplier. \n\nIn addition to meeting with H.M. King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, I also look forward to my discussions with other important members of the Royal family. \n\nWe want the prominent Saudi businesses to partner with India\u2019s development priorities. That would be one of the key objectives of the business event planned in Riyadh. \n\nI will visit the Masmak Fortress, \u2018L&T Workers\u2019 Residential Complex and TCS All Women IT & ITES Center in Riyadh.", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10156832486035165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
