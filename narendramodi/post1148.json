People's enthusiasm & their desire for change is evident.\n\nUnlike Congress, our battle is not personal. Our fight is against poverty, corruption, nepotism, unemployment & we seek welfare of people. Talked about MUDRA Bank, our efforts towards rural electrification, building more roads & how these initiatives will benefit Assam.\n\nGive BJP a chance so that we can transform Assam & make it a model state for progress. http://www.narendramodi.in/pm-shri-narendra-modi-at-a-public-meeting-at-tinsukia-assam-430032", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10156819044845165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
