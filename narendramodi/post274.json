I will always cherish the warmth I received from the people of the state. Since assuming office, our Government is pursuing the \u2018Act East Policy\u2019 to harness the strong development potential of the Northeast. \n\nManipur deserves a better state Government, which can do justice to aspirations of the state\u2019s youth & provide corruption-free governance. One of our most important priorities is to comprehensively improve Manipur\u2019s infrastructure. This will provide speed for Manipur\u2019s growth.\n\nThere is great potential for tourism in Manipur. Manipur can truly contribute a lot to India\u2019s development. http://nm-4.com/vfs0", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10158367363185165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
