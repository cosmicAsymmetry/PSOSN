Today\u2019s rally was a phenomenal one. Happy to see so many people join. \n\nLDF & UDF have a convenient arrangement of ruining Kerala turn by turn. They have not focused either on agriculture or on job creation. Am very proud of every BJP Karyakarta of Kerala. Neither being in Government nor violence by Left deterred them from serving people. I can see emergence of BJP as a strong 3rd force in Kerala. Our Karyakartas will always work for citizen welfare. \n\nDay or night, India or abroad, Centre has always worked tirelessly for well-being of the people of Kerala & will always continue doing so.  http://nm-4.com/xzdo", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10156983393190165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
