This is a project that will irrigate lands & light up homes. The dam is a generator of optimism & belief in the future of Afghanistan.\n\nThe brave Afghan people are sending a strong message that the forces of destruction & death, denial and domination, shall not prevail. India cherishes the friendship with Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, we want to see democracy strike deep roots, people unite & economy prosper.\n\nToday, we are reviving a region, restoring hope, renewing life and redefining Afghanistan\u2019s future. http://nm-4.com/u5iq", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10157088135700165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
