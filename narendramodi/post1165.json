Glad to have attended. \nIn a time when terrorism and extremism have become the most destructive force of our times, the message of Sufism has global relevance.\n\nWe need to reject any link between terror & religion. Those who spread terror in the name of religion are nothing but anti-religious. \n\nCome, together let us challenge violence with kindness & compassion. Let us turn this world into a garden of peace! \nhttp://nm-4.com/wbhj", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10156764866845165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
