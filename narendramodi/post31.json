Our close historical and friendly ties have picked up momentum after H.E. Prime Minister Antonio Costa\u2019s visit to India in January 2017.\n\nI am looking forward to my meeting with PM Costa. Building on our recent discussions, we will review the progress of various joint initiatives and decisions. We will also discuss ways to further enhance the bilateral engagement, especially in the areas of economic cooperation, science & technology, space collaboration and people to people ties. We will deliberate on means to intensify our cooperation in counter-terrorism and on other international issues of mutual interest. I also see significant potential for deepening bilateral trade and investment ties.\n\nI am also keen to interact with the Indian Community in Portugal during the visit.", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10158963060290165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
