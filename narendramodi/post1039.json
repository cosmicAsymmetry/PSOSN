BJP is fully committed to all-round development, inclusive growth. In contrast, when Communists form Govts there are \u2018Hartals\u2019, industries shut & violence is common. For Congress, corruption is everything.\n\nBJP\u2019s sole aim is development. Through \u2018Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\u2019, we want Kerala to grow & ensure that the youth have adequate jobs. http://nm-4.com/9tuo", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10157002307570165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
