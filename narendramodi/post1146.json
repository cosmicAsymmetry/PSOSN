Joined a huge rally in Kharagpur. \n\nCongress & Left fight in Kerala but are friends in WB. Didi likes this 'alliance' too. These 3 parties have let down the people of WB. WB is at a critical juncture. Lack of industry is adversely affecting prospects of youth. Only BJP can change this & create opportunities.\n\nUrged people to think of only one thing while voting- the overall growth of West Bengal. WB's progress is vital for India's progress. \n\nLast 5 years, like the 34 years before that, have been very disappointing for people. Time to give BJP a chance. http://nm-4.com/999j", "type": "photo", "id": "177526890164_10156821584450165", "status_type": "added_photos"}
