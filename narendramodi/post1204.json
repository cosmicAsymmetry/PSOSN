The boost to investment outlay shows our Government's long term vision for the Railways & the Nation. \n\nThe Rail Budget caters to all sections of society. It stands out because it is an infrastructure-led & employment generating budget. It showcases a vision to reorganise, restructure & rejuvenate Railways with new processes, structures, norms & sources of revenue.\n\nLaunch of unreserved, superfast trains, Antyodaya Express & Deen Dayalu coaches illustrate our unwavering commitment to serving the poor. Announcement to strengthen rail connectivity in Manipur & Mizoram is gladdening. Connectivity in Northeast is one of our core priorities.\n\nThe Vision 2020 will make the Indian Railways free from capacity constraints with higher train speed, punctuality & safety. http://nm-4.com/6uyg", "type": "link", "id": "177526890164_10156670373695165", "status_type": "shared_story"}
